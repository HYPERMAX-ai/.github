HYPERMAX is a complete DeFi suite built on HyperEVM to revolutionize onchain asset management. Our platform enables 
users to trade, stake, invest, and borrow in a fully decentralized and transparent way, with a focus on composable 
smart contracts for investment called SmartFunds. Leveraging Hyperliquid’s deep liquidity and orderbook infrastructure, 
we are building the first Onchain Asset Management Protocol (OAMP)—integrating asset management with permissionless DeFi primitives.
